        <h1>30 Medium Dog Breeds That Make Great Pets</h1>
        <ol>
            <li id="1">Collie
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-collie.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>Collies are notorious for their kid-friendliness and showing affection to children. They learn quickly (a solid combination of intelligence and a desire to please) and love running around with their companions. If they get bored, they tend to bark, so include collies in as many activities as possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="2">American Staffordshire Terrier
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-collie-american-staffordshire-terrier.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>These pups are so trainable and energetic, Hollywood uses them frequently in films. In a family setting, they’re sure to contribute the same sweet personality with a healthy dose of loyalty. If you’re planning on getting more dogs, however, think about a different breed. AmStaffs (as they’re called) tend to get aggressive with other canines. But, they’re obedient and boy do they love their people!</p>
            </li>
            <li id="3">Boykin Spaniel
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-boykin-spaniel.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>In a more mellow household, the Boykin spaniel will feel right at home. These dogs are cheerful and unafraid to show affection. After a healthy run around the block, they’ll happily trot home to sleep or head out for a hike, depending on what their families want.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="4">Border Collie
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-border-collie.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>Yes, getting a dog is a lot like having another kid, but this is especially true of border collies. These pups are balls of energy and need tons of attention (and exercise), so a larger family with active kids may be better suited to meet these needs. Obedience is not a problem for these dogs, which is a good thing, so train commands early.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="5">Brittany
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-brittany.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>This is a glass-half-full kind of dog. Brittanys are genuinely upbeat animals who were bred to hunt, so are eager for outdoor time. They’re also extraordinarily amicable, which is obvious after one look into their sweet, puppy dog eyes. If your family likes to bike, hike or spend ample time outdoors, a Brittany is your breed.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="6">Bulldog
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-bulldog.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>Bulldogs are thick teddy bears, ready and willing to follow their families anywhere, be it a city apartment or countryside manor. Always up for friendly games and lazy naps, these charming dogs need enough exercise to stay healthy but don’t require intense excursions beyond the dog park.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="7">Chow Chow
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-chow-chow.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>For a family with younger kiddos, a less hectic schedule or a city zip code, a Chow Chow could be the perfect match. These lovable, fluffy lumps have cat-like tendencies and enjoy lounging alongside their favorite humans. They make great watch dogs as they tend not to trust strangers (which also means training early is crucial).</p>
            </li>
            <li id="8">Dalmatian
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-dalmatian.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>Dalmatians are strong dogs who aren’t afraid to protect their loved ones. They are instinctively vigilant and affectionate. This pup will be just as happy going for long walks with you and your babies in a stroller as she will be going on more rigorous jogs or hikes. Positive reinforcement works best during training.

                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="9">English Springer Spaniel
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-english-springer-spaniel.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>With long, droopy ears and big eyes, these dogs will have you and your family wrapped around their fingers—er, paws. That’s not to say they’re mischievous! These pups genuinely want to spend time with you and will (politely) let you know. They’re smart and love to please, so obedience training is a cinch.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="10">Finnish Spitz
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-finnish-spitz.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>With their pointy ears and orange hue, Finnish Spitz pups look like little foxes! They have as much—if not more—energy, too. They are happy dogs who don’t like to be without their people, but can be wary of strangers, which makes them keen watch dogs. Get ready for plentiful trips to the dog park or playtime in the backyard, as these canines love to run.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="11">Pyrenean Shepherd
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-pyrenean-shepherd.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>This shepherd comes in two varieties: smooth-faced and rough-faced. Both versions are lively and agreeable, ready to learn a new game or follow you wherever you may go. As they’re named after the mountain ranges in which they’ve herded sheep for centuries, don’t leave your Pyrenean Shepherd at home when you’re out at soccer games, family picnics or camping trips. They’re eager for activity!</p>
            </li>
            <li id="12">Samoyed
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-samoyed.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>Just as you’re the alpha dog in your household (aka The Boss), so must you be while training a Samoyed. These lovable, gentle creatures have an independent streak, but have been bred to be unflinchingly loyal to their companions once trained. They’re super social and enjoy meeting new people (and babies). Their gentle disposition also makes them excellent therapy dogs for people with autism.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="13">Standard Schnauzer
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-standard-schnauezer.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>“Must love kids” might be the title of every Standard schnauzer’s autobiography. These dogs live for youthful affection and backyard games of tag or fetch. Loyal to the bone and smart as a whip, don’t leave this pup alone in the yard too long, or he’ll take it personally.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="14">Vizsla
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-vizsla.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>A stunning, rust-colored dog, the congenial Vizsla needs lots of brain and body stimulation. Get out and toss a ball around! Teach this dog new tricks! Be sure to train early, as they like learning but can develop bad habits if not taught how to behave ASAP.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="15">Welsh Springer Spaniel
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-welsh-springer-spaniel.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>This breed has been around for a long time and couldn’t be happier about it. Give ’em something to chase or a family to entertain, and they’re good to go. Welsh springer spaniels get along with other dogs and people of all ages. They also have waterproof coats, so bonus points if you live in a rainy climate.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="16">Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-nova-scotia-duck-tolling-retriever.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>With an almost dignified expression, these dogs are alert, outgoing and ready for whatever the day brings. They’ve got lots of energy and affection to spare. Include kids in training sessions with Tollers, as they tend to try to outwit you, and the more you reward and reinforce their good behavior, the better behaved they’ll be.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="17">Australian Kelpie
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-australian-kelpie.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>Super smart, with a seemingly endless supply of energy, Australian kelpies appreciate having a job to do or orders to follow (as do most Australian breeds). On the flip side, they are also game for a nap or relaxing movie night when the family is ready to calm down. Ideally, you’ve got a yard for them to run around in.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="18">Barbet
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-barbet.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>Talk about a fluffy dog! Barbets have a curly, springy coat perfect for snuggling up against. They are calm for the most part, but make sure they wear themselves out with daily exercise, too. This agreeable breed is a huge fan of water, so if you live near a lake or ocean, consider upping the canine factor on your family trips to the beach (Barbets will feel really left out if you leave them at home).</p>
            </li>
            <li id="19">Icelandic Sheepdog
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-icelandic-sheepdog.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>On the smaller side of the medium-sized dog category sits the cute, curious Icelandic sheepdog. Similar to a Finnish Spitz, these pups have pointy ears and smiling faces. Always up for playtime, these dogs enjoy meeting new friends—both canine and human—so growing families take note.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="20">Small Munsterlander Pointer
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-small-munsterlander-pointer.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>Dedicated to her family through thick and thin, the Small Munsterlander Pointer loves socializing and sees herself as a true member of the group. That said, they were bred to hunt and need lots of outdoor time. City living might not be the best environment, though ample jogs outside or dog park playdates could suffice.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="21">Working Kelpie
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-working-kelpie.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>If you’ve got a wide variety of dispositions in your family already, a working kelpie may be best suited for your crew. These pups know how and when to crank things up and tone things down. Embracing children and other pets comes naturally to these canines, but be sure to give them some mental stimulation in addition to physical exercise.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="22">Siberian Husky
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-siberian-husky.jpg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>If you’ve always wanted a giant Alaskan malamute but don’t have the space, look no further than the friendly Siberian husky. These dogs are fluffy balls of fun who retain their pack mentality (which means the more the merrier).</p>
            </li>
            <li id="23">Cocker Spaniel
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-cocker-spaniel.jpeg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>Sweet and extremely child-friendly, cocker spaniels make great companion pets and family dogs. They can be gentle with babies, athletic with older kids and patient with seniors. As one of America’s most popular breeds, they maintain a humble obedience and aim to please.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="24">Finnish Lapphund
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-finnish-lapphund.jpeg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>Finnish lapphunds are up for games in the park or naps at home, as long as they’re with their people. Families with super busy schedules that keep them away from home a lot should think about a different breed—or take their Finnish lapphund along on the adventure. Their emotional intelligence and sensitive feelings will be hurt if you can’t put them first.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="25">Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-wheatan-terrier.jpeg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>Soft-coated wheaten terriers are slightly stubborn when it comes to training, but exude friendliness that makes them terrific family pets. Bred as farm dogs, they enjoy outdoorsy excursions followed by lazy evenings with their best friends (ahem…you).</p>
            </li>
            <li id="26">Pembroke Welsh Corgi
                <br /><br /><img src="https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/best-medium-sized-dogs-for-families-cardigan-welsh-corgi.jpeg?fit=728%2C921" alt="">
                <p>Known to be excellent companions for folks with anxiety, Pembroke Welsh corgis are highly intelligent and affectionate dogs. They can have fun with people of all ages and adapt well to your family’s schedule. One thing to watch for? Their herding instincts have been known to kick in around large groups of kids… which is very sweet and very funny.</p>

                <p>Beagles are so obsessed with their families, they can develop separation anxiety if left alone too long. They learn commands quickly and enjoy earning treats for a job well done. Incredibly sweet-natured and lovable, they also tend to have slight independent streaks, especially if their strong noses catch a whiff of something to track.</p>

                <p>Cardigan Welsh corgis, unlike their Pembroke counterparts, have tails that wag to indicate how much fun they’re having (which is almost all the time). These pups live for social outings and will make friends wherever they go.</p>

                <p>Say hello to one of the smartest, most outgoing canines you’ll meet. Eskies learn commands quickly and love being near their human family. Like Beagles, they may develop separation anxiety or become destructive if left alone too long. Playtime that involves mental stimulation is best for these fluffy pups.</p>

                <p>Keeshonds are smart, extroverted canines who unabashedly adore their humans. Sure, they need regular exercise, but they are hearty enough to adapt to various lifestyles. Translation: an obedient, friendly, companion dog, perfect for just about any family situation.</p>
