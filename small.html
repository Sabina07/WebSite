        <h1>30 Small Dog Breeds That Make Great Pets</h1>
        <ol>
            <li id="1">Papillon
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/_QIFnizm7_tq8cSnv4t4tCi4dX4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-1067057992-1-95f3c3354cf448e8b746d350e91ff819.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Also called the Continental Toy Spaniel, the Papillon is one of the oldest of the toy spaniels. It derives its pretty French name from its characteristic butterfly-like look of the long and fringed hair on the ears.This little dog has a "big dog" personality, with the energy, endurance, and agility to keep up with the larger dogs. As with all dogs, train early and keep them occupied or she will become yappy.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="2">Chihuahua
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/DFVEG4dKzLii09eTcC1BMO4uM8Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-932004182-1-93a47e5847ee41e18009b97c0ca5cf0d.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Don't let the small size fool you. Chihuahuas may look meek, but they are a powerhouse of attitude. They are known for being loud and demanding, barking constantly at strange dogs and nipping at children (maybe not the best choice for a house with kids). However, the Chihuahua can also be loyal and affectionate and can be the right choice for an older person in a quiet household.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="3">Yorkshire Terrier
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/Aa0XfsZocom2jZY_6JksfbBCAxI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-180671883_0-1-f5626ac532504b7aace816791ec19e41.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Small and spunky, this toy breed has a big personality. Intelligent and playful, a Yorkshire Terrier usually gets along with the family cat and takes charge of larger dogs in his home. However, because his tiny size makes him a bit fragile, he may not be a good choice for a household with small, rambunctious children.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="4">Cocker Spaniel
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/que2uX6urZA2kNn1nUGUYlkig58=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-680852961-1-1e24a51907054be98b6b2e8a5973aec8.jpg" alt="">
                <p>These spaniels make the perfect pets for children; not too small and not too big, they are just the right size. This silky, wavy-haired breed is loyal, affectionate, and easy to train, and wakes up every morning with a strong desire to please his family.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="5">Maltese
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/hDDIo8kgYdNDUyLpW5UGuc7EDHI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-685099175-c8471fd3f61240d58315ae21dcf51e24.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The Maltese, bred as a companion dog, often retains a puppy-like attitude all throughout his life. He is definitely a looker, with those big button eyes and silky coat, which, by the way, is far from maintenance free.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="6">Beagle
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/cd9s08TY3XyGPMjj7JSBor2OuAw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-157603003-1-ce706a0b211446efb5c1bc51af678941.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Beagles are highly spirited and intelligent. Originally bred for hunting rabbits, their keen sense of smell can sometimes make walks interesting, as they try to follow every smell they encounter. Buyer beware: beagles have been known to chew through anything, so give him plenty of safe options other than your shoes, furniture, and the siding on the house.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="7">Bichon Frise
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/THT5ZWjRpHqhT1R_upSJWBMGiQc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-996939804-1-9bb01421ef63450f8950ee00744d9e66.jpg" alt="">
                <p>These adorable faces are guaranteed to make even Scrooge break out in a grin. This little ball of white fur is a born cuddler. Typically affectionate and eager to please, a Bichon does require consistent training to avoid becoming bratty. He may not be a good choice for a family with small or rambunctious children, as he may become injured or frightened to the point of biting.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="8">Boston Terrier
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/OKmPSjKeLT41_wLREoOZRHA1uvY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-637074954-1-45389fb7ae9f4af88108e21bb4d458d6.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Friendly and enthusiastic, the Boston Terrier is typically happy and up for anything, as long as he is with his family. He will enjoy hanging around on the couch with you or going out for a game of fetch. Boston Terriers are sturdy despite their small size and, while he isn't known to be as yappy as other small dogs, he does need exercise and proper training to avoid behavioral issues.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="9">Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/s1gryqDlg0Yrh2-bpprhlUttMVs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-571375045-1-d4f08f3b9aaa47038bfbd2112643bb77.jpg" alt="">
                <p>It may be in his nature to flush birds, but he is also happy taking long walks in the woods or just hanging out with his loving owner. Animated, intuitive, and generally cheerful, these small dogs make wonderful therapy pets. Cavaliers do well in families with older children who will play outside with them and give them much-needed exercise.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="10">Dachshund
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/FCT_7MOJV5XnZfyNNiRiNn_ChIw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-901689804-1-4896aa17032c44eb8514820955c52970.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Bred to exterminate vermin, the small Dachshund actually makes an excellent watchdog. She will become very attached to her owner and family but can also be aggressive around unfamiliar children. The curious and adventure-loving Dachshund is also fond of digging, hunting, chasing game, and tracking by scent.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="11">Italian Greyhound
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/c8ZwYDZ6ZGlsW1dQSlwntqgFEwY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-88087882-1-bc0d33b3c13646138e646131f406be6a.jpg" alt="">
                <p>President John Tyler bought one of these slender dogs for the First Lady in the 1840s. Italian Greyhounds are known to have the same sweet, loyal nature of their taller Greyhound cousins. Their affectionate nature makes them an ideal cuddling companion.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="12">Jack Russell Terrier
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/kkqcLk-nC4hNhEqtbI9pUQK4P-Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-908007550-1-f6e692757b894cc7a7102edd9f227bb0.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Looking for a quiet dog that likes to hang around the house waiting to be pampered? Then a Jack Russell is not for you! This is a very active breed that loves to jump on furniture, run around and lead a generally carefree, stubborn, and boisterous existence. Proper training, however, can help make the dog calmer.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="13">Lhasa Apso
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/sJVZ3zA1lwRj4whNwNnFVnuCVGM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-476211565-1-05b7e78b50844383aa2fd8e5ed6ef5ae.jpg" alt="">
                <p>This tiny dog was bred as an interior sentinel in the Buddhist monasteries to alert the monks to any intruders. Stands to reason that the Lhasa Apso is alert and watchful, is suspicious of strangers and will bark in alarm. They're independent and stubborn but very loyal and faithful to their families.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="14">Miniature Poodle
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/T-Q9-Hush3x-ZVK38fpNgUlQkhc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-168269399-1-504f46df5e7b4c23b90282abe5badef9.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The poodle comes in three sizes: standard, miniature, and toy. The standard is too large to be considered if you want a small dog, but the miniature or toy versions can be just the right size. Poodles are among the smartest of dog breeds and can make an excellent addition to the family. They are easy to train, hardworking, and a tough competitor in sports.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="15">Havanese
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/YhZRciImrxn5rxDP406PC9hIH5k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-173524522-1-2e4cd7173c644990aabcbad74cc799f7.jpg" alt="">
                <p>A Havanese can be a great choice for a family that has never owned a dog. He is intelligent, lively, and loves being spoiled. This breed needs daily exercise and grooming and makes a good companion for gentle and responsible children.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="16">Pekingese
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/WEFEzPd0tD2RDZDdWiaeBA-TwtE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-592689430-1-16b8faacad914432a117d92faea041d5.jpg" alt="">
                <p>This is an ancient breed originating in China. They are called Lion Dogs due to their resemblance to Chinese guardian lions. This small dog comes with a big attitude. Because he is extremely faithful to his family, he makes a good watchdog. His aggressive nature, though, does make the Pekingese unsuitable for a family with children or other pets. His thick undercoat and coarse overcoat require daily grooming.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="17">Pug
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/sSt3KKbkIDhy62Md64k5pYmO2Jg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-861319804-1-ba7610a74a55473e9fd9aed0510d8a54.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The fun-loving Pug is generally a real charmer who tends to get along well with everyone she meets — including children and other animals. She is not a jogging partner, but she does typically enjoy going out wherever you might go. Large for a toy breed, compact and muscular, a Pug is a bit hardier than other small breeds, but still needs supervision when playing with children.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="18">Scottish Terrier
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/PSyuCD6GYN9IKScPVfCzqRQfvVE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-541285864-1-c04419c9e2c14f2ba0ac368533e77b87.jpg" alt="">
                <p>This breed is known for their independent and self-assured nature. They can often be somewhat dour and stubborn, so training a Scottie can be a real test of wills. They tend to be one-person dogs, which make them great companions for a one or two-person household.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="19">Shetland Sheepdog
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/AW2iCdq7LqSESPG23Uaueutm81A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-519622366-1-adbe1ca5350149b8be2f921176988db0.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Good-natured and eager to please, sweet Shelties are easy to train. They make amazing playmates for children and can sometimes be timid and standoffish with strangers. Their big, beautiful coat requires daily grooming.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="20">Pembroke Welsh Corgi
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/4jyg-25sWCD_vhSHJ1M1l-QfUvo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-175803589-1-1b0bafd2ecff4507afa679e68e898287.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Happy, alert, and playful, corgis make great pets for children. They're intelligent and willing to please, making them easy to train. They're good watchdogs and can either be very noisy or very reserved with strangers.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="21">Shih Tzu
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/aLtXogg-FWSuVth2_tm3yjgRRZY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-1125888954-1-8807e5f14ca54feda918b0f0334faa42.jpg" alt="">
                <p>This breed was bred for Chinese royalty and considers the giving and receiving of affection as his primary purposes in life. This typically playful breed tends to be proud — but not arrogant — and responds well to treats and indulgences. In other words, the Shih Tzu is easily spoiled. Consistent training is necessary because if bored or allowed to have his own way, he is likely to get into mischief.</p>
            </li>

                <p>Westies have the sunniest disposition in the terrier family. They will happily adapt to your lifestyle, and they are one of the few terrier breeds that get along well with other pets.</p>

                <p>Definitely attention-seekers, wires display typical terrier characteristics: confidence, determination, and eagerness. They're also prone to high-energy habits like chasing and digging.</p>

                <p>Mellow, gentle and overall adorable dogs, Pomeranians can also sometimes get a bit noisy. This breed is great with children, but it is best introduced into a family as a puppy. Beware, Pomeranians are big shedders, so be prepared for a lot of grooming and vacuuming.</p>

            <li id="25">Whippet
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/WSD5afVIOheJZf8r-DvUa_kPtgs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-974508046-1-93601e2441714f269d7c37dba7f20097.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Similar in look to the Italian Greyhound, a Whippet can reach speeds of up to 35 miles per hour, making them the fastest animal of their size, according to the American Kennel Club. So if you like to run track, this breed might be just what you are looking for.</p>

            <li id="26">Miniature Pinscher
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/0eoepIsqjSOlQTpcK70JKf9VafI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-688980471-1-e25d410631e64e049a71064cb21ce039.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The leggy Miniature Pinscher is known as the "King of Toys." This fearless, proud, and fun-loving small breed has a lustrous coat and a compact, wedge-shaped physique, along with a showy high-stepping "hackney" gait.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="27">Basenji
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/n55E2BTXtagH-XU6Q4_PTw7vIP4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-1047146514-1-63d98d3570b54c07955b9e0e02e42f7d.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The Basenji was bred as hunting dogs in Africa, prized for their intelligence and independence. This quiet and sweet-faced "barkless" dog is best for owners who can meet their exercise needs and the challenge of training this catlike canine.</p>

            <li id="28">Border Terrier
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/0OSLpMw1fDnctO5HqbLCIgFQD9o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-531551140-1-d93aeac51ef946f4ac7cf917221747e6.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Bred as a fox and vermin hunter, plucky and happy border terriers are known to be a tough working breed. They will instinctively hunt and chase animals (and cars), so owners need to be especially vigilant and keep Border Terriers behind the fence.</p>

            <li id="29">Miniature Schnauzer

                <p>This breed has it all in one small package: intelligence, affection, an extroverted temperament, and a personality bigger than its small body. Toss in that walrus-shaped moustache and fun-loving enthusiasm, and you will be laughing every day. With this one in the house you will never be lonely – or alone.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="30">Schipperke
                <br /><br /><img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/rs5kBcUrLFdihcC-ztF1R7df0uY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gettyimages-925144386-1-4ce3ddabc45f4f629f7bbc1cd05124d8.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Topping out at just 16 pounds and 12"-13" tall, these little packages pack a big punch. Known as Belgium's "little captain" and used as a watchdog, the Schipperke is curious, lively, intense, and oh-so mischievous. The fox-like face completes the unique look.</p>
